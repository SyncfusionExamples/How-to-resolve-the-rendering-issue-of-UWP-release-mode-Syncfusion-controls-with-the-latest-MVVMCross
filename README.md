In MVVMCross version 6.12 and above, even we have added those will not render the Syncfusion control. This article mainly to know how to render even with mentioned MVVMCross version with example of SfChart control.

But in release mode, it will be rendered with empty screen even with adding its renderer as below
```
sealed partial class App
    {
        public App()
        {
            this.InitializeComponent();
        }

        protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs activationArgs)
        {
            base.OnLaunched(activationArgs);

            List<Assembly> assembliesToInclude = new List<Assembly>();
            assembliesToInclude.Add(typeof(Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms.UWP.SfChartRenderer).GetTypeInfo().Assembly);
            Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(activationArgs, assembliesToInclude);
        }
    }
```
## How to resolve this issue
It has been resolved by changing the MvxFormsWindowsSetup<Core.App, FormsUI.App> with MVVMCrossSetup as shown in below

**Before code changes:**

```
public abstract class UWPApplication : MvxWindowsApplication<MvxFormsWindowsSetup<Core.App, FormsUI.App>, Core.App, FormsUI.App, MainPage>
    {

    }
```

**After code changes:**

```
public abstract class UWPApplication : MvxWindowsApplication<MVVMCrossSetup, Core.App, FormsUI.App, MainPage>
    {

    }

    public class MVVMCrossSetup : MvxFormsWindowsSetup<Core.App, FormsUI.App>
    {
        public override IEnumerable<Assembly> GetViewAssemblies()
        {
            var syncfusionChartRendererAssembly = new List<Assembly>()
                {
                    typeof(Syncfusion.SfChart.XForms.UWP.SfChartRenderer).GetTypeInfo().Assembly
                };
            syncfusionChartRendererAssembly.AddRange(base.GetViewAssemblies());
            return syncfusionChartRendererAssembly;
        }
    }
```
